# üí° Ideas for Modifying the CrewAI Demo

This page gives you simple ideas to customize and improve the multi-agent demo!

## üéØ Easy Modifications (Start Here!)

### 1. Change Agent Personalities
**What to modify:** The `backstory` in each agent

**Example - Make the Writer more creative:**
```python
writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Write a creative story about the topic",
    backstory="You are a creative storyteller who loves using metaphors and vivid descriptions.",
    llm=llm,
    tools=[],
    verbose=True
)
```

**Example - Make the Editor more strict:**
```python
editor = Agent(
    role="Editor",
    goal="Make the article professional and error-free",
    backstory="You are a strict editor who catches every mistake and ensures professional quality.",
    llm=llm,
    tools=[],
    verbose=True
)
```

### 2. Add More Agents
**What to modify:** Add new agents to the crew

**Example - Add a Fact Checker:**
```python
fact_checker = Agent(
    role="Fact Checker",
    goal="Verify that all facts are accurate",
    backstory="You are careful about accuracy and always double-check information.",
    llm=llm,
    tools=[],
    verbose=True
)

# Add to crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer, fact_checker, editor],  # Added fact_checker
    tasks=[research_task, write_task, fact_check_task, edit_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True
)
```

### 3. Change the Output Format
**What to modify:** The `expected_output` in tasks

**Example - Make it a social media post:**
```python
write_task = Task(
    description="Write a social media post using the research facts",
    expected_output="A catchy social media post with hashtags (under 280 characters)",
    agent=writer
)
```

**Example - Make it a presentation outline:**
```python
write_task = Task(
    description="Create a presentation outline using the research facts",
    expected_output="A structured presentation with 5 slides: title, intro, 3 main points, conclusion",
    agent=writer
)
```

### 4. Add Different Topics Automatically
**What to modify:** Add topic suggestions

```python
# Add this after the topic input
st.write("**Or try these examples:**")
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
with col1:
    if st.button("AI in Medicine"):
        st.session_state.topic = "How AI is helping doctors diagnose diseases"
with col2:
    if st.button("Space Exploration"):
        st.session_state.topic = "Why humans should explore Mars"
with col3:
    if st.button("Climate Change"):
        st.session_state.topic = "How renewable energy can save the planet"
```

## üîß Medium Modifications

### 5. Add Web Search
**What to modify:** Add search tools to agents

```python
# Add at the top
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

# Create search tool
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()

# Give it to researcher
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Find recent, accurate information about the topic",
    backstory="You search the internet for the latest information.",
    llm=llm,
    tools=[search_tool],  # Add search tool here
    verbose=True
)
```

### 6. Change the Process Type
**What to modify:** Change from sequential to hierarchical

```python
# Instead of Process.sequential, use:
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    tasks=[research_task, write_task, edit_task],
    process=Process.hierarchical,  # This allows agents to delegate tasks
    verbose=True
)
```

### 7. Add Memory Between Runs
**What to modify:** Enable memory for the crew

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    tasks=[research_task, write_task, edit_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    memory=True,  # This remembers previous conversations
    verbose=True
)
```

## üöÄ Advanced Modifications

### 8. Create Different Workflows
**What to modify:** Create multiple crew types

```python
# Add buttons for different workflows
workflow_type = st.selectbox(
    "Choose workflow:",
    ["Article Writer", "Social Media Manager", "Presentation Creator"]
)

if workflow_type == "Social Media Manager":
    # Create different agents for social media
    # ... different agent configurations
```

### 9. Add File Upload
**What to modify:** Let users upload files for agents to work with

```python
# Add file upload
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a file for agents to analyze")

if uploaded_file:
    # Add file content to the research task
    research_task = Task(
        description=f"Analyze this file and research: {topic}",
        expected_output="Analysis of the file plus research findings",
        agent=researcher
    )
```

### 10. Add Progress Tracking
**What to modify:** Show detailed progress

```python
# Add progress bars
progress_bar = st.progress(0)
status_text = st.empty()

# Update progress as agents work
status_text.text("Researcher is working...")
progress_bar.progress(33)
# ... continue for each agent
```

## üé® Creative Ideas

### 11. Role-Playing Scenarios

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Agent not working properly"
**Solution:** Check the backstory - make it more specific about what you want

### Issue: "Output is too long/short"
**Solution:** Modify the `expected_output` to be more specific about length

### Issue: "Agents repeating same information"
**Solution:** Add more specific instructions in the task descriptions

### Issue: "API errors"
**Solution:** Check your API key and make sure you have credits

## üéì Learning Goals

After modifying this code, you should understand:
- How to create different AI personalities
- How to design workflows for specific tasks
- How to combine multiple AI agents
- How to customize AI behavior through prompts

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Start Simple:** Try changing just the backstories first
2. **Add One Agent:** Create a new agent with a specific role
3. **Experiment:** Try different topics and see how agents respond
4. **Build Something Cool:** Create your own multi-agent system!
